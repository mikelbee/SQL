# This project was completed using the SQL Murder Mystery Challenge database and resourcefrom https://mystery.knightlab.com/#experienced. I am particularly proud of my SQL for this challenge as I only completed it with one query.

# Here the conditions of the advanced level of the mystery.
# Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more...
# If you think you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime.
# If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries.

# I joined two CTEs for this project to produce a filtered result.

# First, I created the conditions of the first CTE using the SQL below.

SELECT *
FROM person p
JOIN drivers_license dl ON p.license_id = dl.id
WHERE dl.height = 65 OR 67
AND dl.hair_color = 'red'
AND dl.car_make = 'Tesla'
AND dl.car_model = 'Model S'

# Next, I created the created condition for the second CTE below.

SELECT *
FROM facebook_event_checkin fb
JOIN person p ON p.id = fb.person_id
WHERE date LIKE '201712%'
AND event_name LIKE '%SQL Symphony Concert%'

# Finally, I joined the two CTEs and queried it to produce the suspect.

SELECT DISTINCT pdl.name
FROM pdl
INNER JOIN facebookEvent ON pdl.license_id = facebookEvent.license_id
WHERE gender = 'female';

# This is the final query I wrote to find the final suspect.

WITH pdl AS(
SELECT *
FROM person p
JOIN drivers_license dl ON p.license_id = dl.id
WHERE dl.height = 65 OR 67
AND dl.hair_color = 'red'
AND dl.car_make = 'Tesla'
AND dl.car_model = 'Model S'),

facebookEvent AS(
SELECT *
FROM facebook_event_checkin fb
JOIN person p ON p.id = fb.person_id
WHERE date LIKE '201712%'
AND event_name LIKE '%SQL Symphony Concert%'
)

SELECT DISTINCT pdl.name
FROM pdl
INNER JOIN facebookEvent ON pdl.license_id = facebookEvent.license_id
WHERE gender = 'female';
