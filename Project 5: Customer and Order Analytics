#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT
  COUNT(orderID)
FROM
    BIT_DB.JanSales    
WHERE LENGTH(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT 
    COUNT(product)
FROM
    BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE
    product = 'iPhone';


#3. Select the customer account numbers (acctnum) for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM
    BIT_DB.FebSales f
INNER JOIN
    BIT_DB.customers c
ON
    f.orderID = c.order_id
WHERE
    length(orderid)=6
AND
    orderid<> 'Order ID';


#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT
    MIN(price), Product
FROM
    BIT_DB.JanSales;


#OR

SELECT
    MIN(price), Product
FROM
    BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY
    price ASC
LIMIT
    1;


#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT
    product, SUM(quantity)*price AS total_revenue
FROM 
    BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY
    product;


#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT
    product,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity, SUM(quantity)*price AS total_revenue
FROM
    BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE
    location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT
    COUNT(DISTINCT c.acctnum) AS total_customers,
     AVG(f.quantity)*price AS average_expense
 FROM
     BIT_DB.FebSales f
 LEFT JOIN
     BIT_DB.customers c
 ON
     c.order_id = f.orderID
WHERE
     f.quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


#8 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.
SELECT
    Product,
    SUM(Quantity)
FROM
    BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE
    location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;


#9 Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).
SELECT
    location, count(orderID) AS total_order
FROM
    BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE
    location LIKE '%NY%'
    AND length(orderID) = 6
    AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY
    location
HAVING
    count(orderID) >= 3;


#10 How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT
    PRODUCT,
    SUM(quantity) AS quantity
FROM
    BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE
    Product LIKE '%Headphone%'
GROUP BY Product;


#11 What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hints: For this question, we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account. To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)
SELECT
    AVG(quantity*price)
FROM
    BIT_DB.FebSales f

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
    ON c.order_id = f.orderID
    
WHERE length (orderID) = 6
    AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


#12 What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 3, we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).

SELECT
    SUM(f.quantity)/COUNT(c.acctnum)
FROM
    BIT_DB.FebSales f

LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers c
    ON c.order_id = f.orderID

WHERE length (orderID) = 6
    AND orderID <> 'Order ID';


#13 Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT
    Product,
    SUM(ROUND(quantity*price)) AS total_revenue
FROM
    BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY
    Product
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT
    1;
