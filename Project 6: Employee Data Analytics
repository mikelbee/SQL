# In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about employees and other relevant information. 

# 1.Display all of the rows of the employees table, showing only the employees’ first and last names.
SELECT
    first_name,
    last_name
FROM
    employees;

# 2.Display all employees who were hired after August 1, 1999 (non-inclusive).
SELECT
    first_name || ' ' || last_name AS employee_name
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    hire_date > '1999-08-01';

# 3.In this database, two tables are of the same schema. Combine them using a Union operator.
SELECT * FROM dept_emp
UNION
SELECT * FROM dept_manager;

# 4.Display the identifier and different salaries of the employee who was born on this date:  '1964-01-31', using a join.

SELECT
    employees.emp_no,
    salaries.salary
FROM salaries
JOIN employees ON employees.emp_no = salaries.emp_no
WHERE employees.birth_date = '1964-01-31';

# 5.Using the join operator, produce a table specifying the name(s) of the department(s) in which the employee associated with identifier 499902 has worked (the table must also contain the start and end dates of employment in each department, as well as the employee’s last name and first name).

SELECT
    e.first_name,
    e.last_name,
    d.dept_name,
    d2.from_date,
    d2.to_date
FROM
    employees e
JOIN
    dept_emp d2 ON e.emp_no = d2.emp_no
JOIN
    departments d ON d.dept_no = d2.dept_no
WHERE
    e.emp_no = '499902';


# 6.Using aggregation, find out how many people have the last name "Gewali" (the last name is provided in the last_name column of the "employees" table).

SELECT COUNT
    (last_name)
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    last_name = 'Gewali';
